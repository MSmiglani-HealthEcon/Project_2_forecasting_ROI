# Project 2: Forecasting Diabetes Healthcare Costs & ROI Analysis

## Description
This project forecasts diabetes-related healthcare costs in India for the next 10 years and evaluates the potential impact of a preventive intervention using ROI analysis. The analysis combines historical cost data, moving averages, linear regression forecasting, and intervention cost modeling.

## Files
- **Data:** Cleaned historical cost CSV, forecast CSV, ROI analysis CSV
- **Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook with Python code for data cleaning, forecasting, and ROI calculations
- **Plots:** Visualizations of forecasted costs, moving averages, and intervention ROI
- **Excel Model:** Placeholder for future export of calculations (currently empty)
- **Report:** Placeholder for future written summary (currently empty)

## Methods
1. Load historical healthcare cost data
2. Compute 3-year moving averages
3. Perform linear regression forecasting for 10-year projection
4. Model a preventive intervention and calculate annual savings
5. Compute ROI based on intervention cost vs forecasted savings
6. Visualize historical, forecasted, and intervention-adjusted costs

## Results
- Forecasted diabetes healthcare costs for 2025–2034
- Cost reduction scenarios with intervention
- ROI calculation for the intervention
- Publication-ready plots summarizing trends and savings
